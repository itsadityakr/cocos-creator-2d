## Spawning Prefabs in a Grid and Setting Label using Counter

<img src="./project1/thumbnail.gif" alt="project preview" width="200">

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates how to spawn a prefab dynamically and update its label using a counter. Every time a button is clicked, a new box is created and added to a UI panel with a unique number based on the counter.

**What This Project Does:**

* Spawns a prefab each time the button is clicked.
* Adds the prefab to a UI panel.
* Displays a unique number on each prefab via Label.

---

## Spawn Prefabs Randomly within an Area and Remove All Prefabs

<img src="./project2/thumbnail.gif" alt="project preview" width="200">

**Overview:**
Learn how to spawn prefabs randomly within a defined area and remove them when needed.

**What This Project Does:**

* Spawns prefabs at random positions in a defined area.
* Removes all spawned prefabs when the "Remove All" button is clicked.

---

## Rotating Object around a Central Node and Button to Increase/Decrease Speed

<img src="./project3/thumbnail.gif" alt="project preview" width="200">

**Overview:**
A rotating object follows a circular path around a central node with adjustable speed.

**What This Project Does:**

* Circular rotation using trigonometric functions.
* Buttons to increase/decrease rotation speed.
* Toggle rotation on/off.

---

## Drag-and-Drop with Reset Feature

<img src="./project4/thumbnail.gif" alt="project preview" width="200">

**Overview:**
Implements drag-and-drop mechanics with a reset if the cursor leaves the canvas.

**What This Project Does:**

* Draggable sprite.
* Auto-aligns to drop zone center if dropped inside.
* Resets position if cursor leaves canvas.

---

## Toggle Between Two Images on Click using Sprite Frame

<img src="./project5/thumbnail.gif" alt="project preview" width="200">

**Overview:**
Toggles between two images on a node when the user clicks.

**What This Project Does:**

* Switches between two sprite frames on click.
* Uses `@property` to expose image assets and node in the editor.
* Maintains a state flag to determine the current image.

---

## Toggle Between Two Colored Backgrounds on Click

<img src="./project6/thumbnail.gif" alt="project preview" width="200">

**Overview:**
Switches between red and green backgrounds each time the user clicks.

**What This Project Does:**

* Alternates active state of two background nodes.
* Uses a boolean flag for state tracking.
* Demonstrates conditional rendering logic.

---

## Instantiate Prefab with Random Color and Incrementing Label

<img src="./project7/thumbnail.gif" alt="project preview" width="200">

**Overview:**
Creates multiple prefab instances with unique colors and labels.

**What This Project Does:**

* Instantiates a prefab on button click.
* Assigns a random background color.
* Labels each prefab with a unique number using a counter.
* Adjusts visibility using opacity.
